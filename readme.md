I made this scripts to make simpler some stuff.

updateRepo.sh -> You can use this script to make a git add . git commit -m and git push origin branch. Just enter commit's name and be sure yo be on the branch you are/were working. (IMPROVING)

main.sh -> Programs that I use for daily programming work and more. Now is Ubuntu 24.04.1 based script for WSL2
